I am a freshman at the University of Florida studying Computer Engineering. I have always surrounded myself with technology and took a strong interest in web development when I was younger. 

At the age of 11, I created my first website dedicated to a technology review blog that I founded in 2007 called iTalkTech. After spending months learning new techniques, it was clear to me that my interests fell into the category of web development. As I got older, I began taking classes online to learn graphic design to compliment my growing web design skills. 

In high school, I took a large interest in the student-run newspaper program. During my four year experience on the Wharton High School Predator staff, I put my web design skills and eagerness to learn Wordpress API to the test and created an online reading medium for the paper that allowed staff members to login and upload their articles and photos. Additionally, I used my graphic design skills to create full-page spreads and advertisements for local businesses. In 2013, I won the National Scholastic Press Association Pacemaker Award for personal excellence in page design, content, and web presence. 

Currently, I work at the Center of Macromolecular Science and Engineering within the University of Florida College of Chemistry, where my job responsibilities include website management and development. Additionally, I am a freelance graphic designer and web designer and have recently taken a large interest in social media management and search engine optimization.
